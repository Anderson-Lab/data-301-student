# Chapter 0. Introduction to Data Science

## 0.1 Data Science as a Field

What does data science look like today? Well. It depends on who you ask. Industry or academics. Statistics folks or computer science folks. Small company or large company. Tech company or company using tech. It really depends on who you ask which is the case for most fields, but this is especially true in data science.

So how do we teach data science? It's important to start with the type of data scientist we want to train and at what level of expertise. For the sake of discussion, consider the following three levels. The first level is data science literacy and understanding. This type of data scientist isn't really a data scientist at all, but they know something about the field that can help them in their lives. The second level of data scientist is often a domain expert with a basic understanding of the field in general and a deep understanding in their domain and possibly one area of data science (e.g., neural networks). The third type of data science has a broad and deep understanding of the field. This book is aimed at the second and third type of data scientist.
