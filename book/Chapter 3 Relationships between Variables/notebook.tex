\section{3.3 Relationships between Two Quantitative
Variables}\label{relationships-between-two-quantitative-variables}}

In this chapter, we discuss ways to summarize and visualize
relationships between \emph{quantitative} variables. To illustrate the
concepts, we use the Ames housing data set.

Let's start by visualizing the relationship between the square footage
(of the dwelling) and the sale price, both of which are quantitative
variables. To do this, we can make a \textbf{scatterplot}. In a
scatterplot, each observation is represented by a point. The \((x, y)\)
coordinates of each point represent the values of two variables for that
observation.

To make a scatterplot in \texttt{pandas}, we use the
\texttt{.plot.scatter()} method of \texttt{DataFrame}. Since there are
multiple columns in the \texttt{DataFrame}, we have to specify which
variable is \(x\) and which variable is \(y\).

    We see that square footage (of the dwelling) and the sale price have a
positive relationship. That is, the greater the living area, the higher
the sale price.

    \hypertarget{summary-statistics}{%
\subsection{Summary Statistics}\label{summary-statistics}}

To summarize the relationship between two quantitative variables \(X\)
and \(Y\), we can report the \emph{covariance} between them, defined as

\[ \text{Cov}[X, Y] = \frac{1}{n - 1} \sum_x \sum_y (x - \text{mean}[X]) (y - \text{mean}[Y])\]

The sign of the covariance will match the direction of the relationship
between the two variables. The figures below illustrate why. If two
variables are positively related, then the scatterplot might look as
follows, with most points in the upper-right and lower-left quadrants
(when you divide up the plane into four quadrants based on the means of
\(X\) and \(Y\)).

\includegraphics{positive_cov.png}

Each point on this scatterplot contributes to the sum that makes up the
covariance. Any point in the upper-right quadrant (where \(x\) and \(y\)
are both greater than their respective means) has a positive
contribution, since the product of two positive numbers is positive. A
point in the lower-left quadrant (where \(x\) and \(y\) are both less
than their respective means) also has a positive contribution, since the
product of two negative numbers is also positive. Therefore, on the
whole, the covariance will be positive for two variables with a positive
relationship.

We can also consider two variables with a negative relationship. A
scatterplot of two negatively-related variables might look as follows,
with most points in the upper-left and lower-right quadrants. Points in
both of these quadrants will have a negative contribution towards the
covariance, since the product of a positive and a negative number is
negative.

\includegraphics{negative_cov.png}

What does it mean for the covariance to be \emph{zero}? It does not
necessarily mean that there is \emph{no} relationship at all between the
two variables; it just means that the two variables do not move in a
consistent direction. For example, the two variables below have
\emph{zero} covariance because the negative contributions from the
upper-left and lower-right quadrants perfectly cancel out the positive
contributions from the upper-right and lower-left quadrants. However, it
would be inaccurate to say that \(X\) and \(Y\) have \emph{no}
relationship; they have a strong relationship, but it just is not
consistently in one direction.

\includegraphics{zero_cov.png}

To calculate the covariance between two quantitative variables, we use
the \texttt{.cov()} method in \texttt{pandas}. This method is attached
to one \texttt{Series} and takes another \texttt{Series} of the same
length as input. It returns the covariance between the two
\texttt{Series}.

    The covariance between the two variables is positive, as should be
apparent from the scatterplot above. Larger houses sell for higher
prices.

One criticism of the covariance is that the value itself is difficult to
interpret, and covariances are not comparable across different
variables. As we did with the \(\chi^2\) distance in the previous
section, we can normalize the covariance. This \emph{normalized
covariance} is called the \textbf{correlation} and is symbolized \(r\):

\[ r = \frac{\text{Cov}[X, Y]}{\text{SD}[X] \text{SD}[Y]} \]

The correlation has all of the important properties of covariance:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A positive correlation indicates a positive relationship between the
  variables. As one increases, so does the other.
\item
  A negative correlation indicates a negative relationship between the
  variables. As one increases, the other tends to decrease.
\item
  A zero correlation means that the two variables do not move in a
  consistent direction, but does not necessarily mean that they have
  \emph{no} relationship.
\end{itemize}

But the correlation is also guaranteed to be between \(-1\) and \(1\),
so it can be compared across data sets.

What does a maximal correlation of \(\pm 1\) mean? It means that the
data fall perfectly along a line.

\includegraphics{corr_1.png}

Correlation is calculated in \texttt{pandas} in much the same way that
covariance is, using the \texttt{.corr()} method:

    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
{\color{incolor}In [{\color{incolor} }]:} \PY{n}{housing\PYZus{}df}\PY{p}{[}\PY{l+s+s2}{\PYZdq{}}\PY{l+s+s2}{Gr Liv Area}\PY{l+s+s2}{\PYZdq{}}\PY{p}{]}\PY{o}{.}\PY{n}{corr}\PY{p}{(}\PY{n}{housing\PYZus{}df}\PY{p}{[}\PY{l+s+s2}{\PYZdq{}}\PY{l+s+s2}{SalePrice}\PY{l+s+s2}{\PYZdq{}}\PY{p}{]}\PY{p}{)}
\end{Verbatim}


    Like the covariance, the correlation \(r\) is positive, but it is a
number between \(-1\) and \(+1\). \(r=+1\) would mean that all of the
points on the scatterplot fell perfectly along a line (with positive
slope). Although the points in the scatterplot do not all fall perfectly
on a line, they do seem to hover around an underlying line. This
explains why the covariance is close to, but not equal to, \(1\).
