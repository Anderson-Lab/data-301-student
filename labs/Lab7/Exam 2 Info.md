# Exam 2 Info

Exam 2 will be in class on Tuesday, March 5. You will have the entire class period (170 minutes) to complete the exam. It is open-book, open-Internet. The only rule is that you cannot communicate with another person during the exam.

Your Exam 2 will require you to 

- query data from the [Zomato API](https://developers.zomato.com/api) (You will need an API key. Make sure you register one before the exam.)
- train machine learning models on this data
- work with some of the text features in this data.

I encourage you to practice querying data from this API and fitting machine learning models to the data, in order to prepare for this exam.

Good luck!
