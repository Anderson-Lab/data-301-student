# # Exam 1 Info
#
# Exam 1 will be in class on Tuesday, February 5. You will have the entire class period (170 minutes) to complete the exam. It is open-book, open-Internet. The only rule is that you cannot communicate with another person during the exam.
#
# Your Exam 1 will consist of eight questions about a data set of used cars, available here: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dlsun/data-science-book/master/data/usedcars.csv`. I encourage you to explore this data set, come up with interesting questions, and answer those questions to prepare for the exam.
#
# Good luck!
