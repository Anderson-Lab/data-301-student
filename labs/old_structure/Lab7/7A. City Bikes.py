# # 7A. CityBikes
#
# This section asks you to fetch JSON data from the [CityBikes REST API](https://api.citybik.es/v2/) to answer some questions about bike share programs in Great Britain.

# # Question 1
#
# Find all cities with bike share programs in Great Britain (country code "GB"), along with their network ID (for example, "nextbike-glasgow"). How many cities are there?

# +
# TYPE YOUR CODE HERE.
# -

# # Question 2
#
# How many total bike share bicycles are there in all of Great Britain? You may assume that the number of bikes at a station is the number of empty spaces, plus the number of available bikes.

# +
# TYPE YOUR CODE HERE.
# -

# # Question 3
#
# You have just finished touring Windsor Castle, which is located at latitude 51.483882 and longitude -0.604405. Find the nearest bike station with an available bike, based on taxicab distance (a.k.a. Manhattan distance)

# TYPE YOUR CODE HERE.

# # Submission Instructions
#
# You do not need to submit this lab. However, I encourage you to check that your code runs correctly from start to finish.
#
# 1. Restart the kernel and re-run this notebook from beginning to end by going to `Kernel > Restart Kernel and Run All Cells`.
# 2. If this process stops halfway through, that means there was an error. Correct the error and repeat Step 1 until the notebook runs from beginning to end.
# 3. Double check that there is a number next to each code cell and that these numbers are in order.
